## First Boot

Upon the first boot of the ESP32 NAT Router, a WiFi network with an open AP and an ssid of "ESP32_NAT_Router +" will be available. Users can configure the device using either a simple web interface or the serial console.

## Web Config Interface

The ESP32 NAT Router has a web interface that allows you to configure all its parameters. To access this interface, connect your PC or smartphone to the WiFi SSID "ESP32_NAT_Router+". Once you're connected, open your web browser and enter

"[http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1/)''Â  into the address bar of your browser. Once you have entered this, you will be prompted for a username and password. The default `username is "admin" `and the default` password is "123456789"`. Please note that it is recommended to change these to a more secure username and password once you have logged in:

To configure the uplink WiFi network, follow these steps: 

1. Go to "Settings" in the web interface of the ESP32 NAT Router 
2. Enter the appropriate values for the "STA Settings" section. If it is an open network, leave the password field blank 
3. Change the "AP Settings" and other customizations as necessary 
4. Click on the "Save" button to save the configuration 
5. Press the "Reboot" button located at the bottom right corner of the page (Nessory)
6. Wait for the device to reboot

Connect to the newly configured WiFi network with the updated settings. 
By following these steps, you can reconfigure the ESP32 NAT Router to connect to a new uplink WiFi network with customized settings based on your preferences.

**Note:** The 5th step is necessary to update certain settings on the device and apply them. Skipping this step may result in the settings not being properly applied, which can lead to issues with the device's functionality. Therefore, it is recommended to always complete the 5th step when making any changes to the device's settings in order to ensure that the device is functioning as expected and that any desired changes have been properly applied.

### First install/ Reset (Terminal/CMD)

Please note that if your device was previously used for other projects, or if you want to reset all settings from a previous version, executing the following steps will result in complete data loss.

Note: replace X.X.X with respective Version.(eg. ...._v1.0.0.bin)

Unpack archive first and then execute:

Single bin method (merged, 0x0): 

```
esptool.py write_flash 0x0 esp32nat_Router+_full_vX.X.X_0x0.bin 
```

Multi bin method:

```
esptool.py --chip esp32 \
--before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash \
-z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 40m --flash_size detect \
0x1000 bootloader.bin \
0x8000 partitions.bin \
0x10000 esp32nat_Router+_vX.X.X.bin
```

### Update from older version

If this project was already installed. No data loss from previous version. 

```
esptool.py write_flash 0x10000 esp32nat_Router+_vX.X.X.bin 
```

If any problem occurs, erase flash manually before flashing:

```
esptool.py erase_flash
```

### OTA method :

To perform an OTA update on the ESP32-NATS Router+, follow these steps:

2. Click on the "Update" button
3. Select the desired bin file for the update

Please note that the OTA method only supports updating with a single bin file, such as "esp32nat_Router+_vX.X.X.bin". Updating with a full bin (merged to single bin 0x0) is not supported.
